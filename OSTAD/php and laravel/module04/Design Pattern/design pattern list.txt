There are several recognized software design patterns, each addressing different aspects of software development and design. Here's a list of some common design patterns:

### Creational Patterns:
1. **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
2. **Factory Method Pattern:** Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
3. **Abstract Factory Pattern:** Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
4. **Builder Pattern:** Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.
5. **Prototype Pattern:** Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

### Structural Patterns:
1. **Adapter Pattern:** Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
2. **Bridge Pattern:** Separates an objectâ€™s abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
3. **Composite Pattern:** Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
4. **Decorator Pattern:** Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
5. **Facade Pattern:** Provides a simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use.
6. **Flyweight Pattern:** Minimizes memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with related objects.
7. **Proxy Pattern:** Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### Behavioral Patterns:
1. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern:** Passes a request along a chain of handlers.
2. **Command Pattern:** Turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request.
3. **Interpreter Pattern:** Defines a grammar for a language and provides an interpreter to interpret sentences in the language.
4. **Iterator Pattern:** Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
5. **Mediator Pattern:** Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling between them.
6. **Memento Pattern:** Captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
7. **Observer Pattern:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
8. **State Pattern:** Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
9. **Strategy Pattern:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
10. **Template Method Pattern:** Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
11. **Visitor Pattern:** Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. It lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

These are some of the common design patterns, and there are variations and combinations that developers can use based on specific requirements and scenarios. Understanding these patterns can help in creating more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software solutions.
